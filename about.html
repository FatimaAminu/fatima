            After school, while awaiting admission, she decided to learn make up and fashion designing to an extent cause damn it!!!, she loves to look good, she had fun and learned a lot during the training, buh it wasn‚Äôt something she pictured herself taking on full time, so she lost interest.

But the beauty you get as a result was worth the time. She attended a training that lasted for two weeks, did her personal learning and research, got materials online to aid her journey.
